> *... and some other servers*

If you're here for [the rINSTAGIB gamemode](https://github.com/jack-avery/rinstagib)

Enjoy the servers, or just found the playbooks useful? [Buy me a coffee â˜•](https://ko-fi.com/raspy)!

## Usage

Ansible requires Linux. If you're running Windows, consider setting up WSL.

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Python requirements.
2. Ensure you have Ansible and Docker installed on your machine.
3. Ensure your Ansible Hosts have Docker installed, and a user named `tf2server` with the `docker` role.

### Creating base image
1. Trigger `make base`.<br/>
-- *Note you probably don't need to run this as the base image the playbooks use is already public on DockerHub.*

### Creating servers
1. Build your Ansible inventory and global/host variables using the samples:
* `inventory.yml.sample`
* `group_vars/tf2.secret.yml.sample`
* `host_vars/local.secret.yml.sample`
2. Trigger `make sm` to distribute and build SourceMod on hosts.
3. Trigger `make srcds` to build images and run servers.
> You can use `make all` instead to do `sm` then `srcds`.

### Updating admins/reserveslots
1. Trigger `make admins`.<br/>
-- Define admins and moderators in `tf2.secret.yml`<br/>
-- Define users with reserve slots to specific servers in `{host}.secret.yml`
